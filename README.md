#flipflop

## ezmode geek blogging, like wearing sandals

It's a node.js library that can both serve a markdown file based blog, and also generate a static site from those files as well. [GG][].

+	**[markdown][]** - articles are stored in markdown formatted text files.
+	**[jade][]** - the theme can be customized via jade templates & [less][]
+	run it from a [node.js http server](#start-er-up), or [generate a static site](#static-sites-are-hawt) that you can host pretty much anywhere and not worry about dependencies.

---

##Installation

**flipflop** provides a cli interface so needs a global install

```
> npm install -g flipflop
```

##Create a new blog

```
> flipflop create
```

This starts a cli app that will prompt for a few bits of info about your blog, and create a directory for it in the `process.cwd()`.

##Start 'er up

Make sure you're inside your blog's directory.

```
> flipflop start <port>
```
check your browser @ `http://localhost:8080`
+	port is optional, defaults to 8080

##Static sites are hawt

Also, from inside your blog's directory.

```
> flipflop generate
```

This will create a static version of your site in a `public` folder within your blog's directory

##Config

Generating a blog with `flipflop create` produces a `blog.json` file in your blog's root directory.  Customize it as you want.

```javascript
{
	"title": "flipflip blog",
	"description": "ezmode geek blogging, like wearing sandals",
	"keywords": [],
	"authors": {
		"bradharris": {
			"name": "Brad Harris",
			"gravatar": "bmharris@gmail.com",
			"github": "bmharris"
		}
	},
	"articles": "articles",
	"domain": "http://yourdomain.com"
}
```
###Options
Many of these properties are used within the blog's template files.

+	`title` the title of your blog
+	`description` the description of your blog
+	`keywords` array of keywords describing your blog, used for the `<meta name="keyword"/>` tag
+	`authors` key/value object containing article authors' information.  This is used to display information about an article's author on the associated article page.
+	`articles` location of directory containing articles.  This defaults to a location relative to your blog's directory but can be absolute as well.
+	`domain` used for creating absolute paths for your blog's feed

##Write some articles

There will soon be a cli command to generate a new article for you, but you can always create them manually.  Simply create a folder inside your blog's `articles` folder.  Whatever you name the folder will be used as the slug for the url (in combination with the article's date), so keep the folder url friendly.  Populate it with an `article.json` file and an `article.md` file.

```
- some-post
	- article.json
	- article.md
```

###article.json

```
{
	"author": "bradharris",
	"title": "flipflop ftw",
	"date": "05/04/2012",
	"publish": true,
	"tags": [
		"flipflop",
		"javascript",
		"node.js"
	]
}
```
###Options
+	`author` should be a key that maps to the blog config `authors` object
+	`title` title of the post, doesn't need to be url friendly
+	`date` date the article was published - a string Date.parse can handle correctly
+	`publish` true/false - if false the article won't be accessible/generated
+	`tags` array containing tags describing the article.

###article.md

Not much to describe here, just a markdown formatted file containing your article.  **flipflop** uses [marked][] to process markdown files, which supports [GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm].
